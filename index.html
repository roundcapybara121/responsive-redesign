                <p>"'The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes' delivers a mesmerizing look into the life of Coriolanus Snow
                    and the root causes of his villainous behavior. Collins once again proves that she is a master of
                    building a fascinating world around complex characters who must grapple with the complications of
                    chaos and control and their effects on human nature."
                </p>
                <p>--The Associated Press</p>
                <p>"It's the pull between Coryo's head and heart — and the realization that he actually has a beating
                    heart, not just a rose-scented lump of coal — that makes the future President Snow very worthy of a
                    517-page prequel."
                </p>
                <p>--The Washington Post</p>
                <p>"Both a tense, character-driven piece and a cautionary tale...The twists and heartbreaks captivate
                    despite tragic inevitabilities."
                </p>
                <p>--Kirkus Reviews, STARRED REVIEW</p>
                <p>"If you read The Hunger Games in one sitting, settle in for the long haul once more—because The
                    Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is nearly impossible to put down...The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes
                    is incredibly exciting, thought-provoking, and relevant."
                </p>
                <p>--Amazon Book Review</p>
                <p>"A sleek Hunger Games prequel...The plot of the novel rests on deception and pretence, its view of
                    humanity bleak; yet Collins's themes of friendship, betrayal, authority and oppression, as well as
                    the extra layers of lore about mockingjays and Capitol's history, will please and thrill."
                </p>
                <p>--The Guardian</p>
                <p>"A gripping mix of whipsaw plot twists and propulsive writing make this story's complex
                    issues—vulnerability and abuse, personal responsibility, and institutionalized power dynamics—vivid
                    and personal."
                </p>
                <p>--Publishers Weekly</p>
                <p>"Fans will appreciate revisiting the world of Panem, and teens may relate to Coriolanus beginning to
                    grapple with big ideas like human nature and whether people on opposite sides of a war are
                    fundamentally different."
                </p>
                <p>--School Library Journal</p>
                <p>"A Hunger Games without Everdeen might have seemed as peculiar as a Potter without Harry, but it
                    works beautifully, largely thanks to a new character. The clever, charismatic precursor, Lucy Baird
                    Gray, a Covey (a sort of gypsy) who is chosen to represent District 12 in the tenth Games. She is a
                    folk singer of prophetic ballads and has a thing about snakes. She is gorgeous, of course, in her
                    late mother's old rainbow dress (the casting for the film, confirmed by Lionsgate, will be fun)."
                </p>
                <p>--The Times</p>
                <p>"[B]y introducing a new cast of teenagers, Collins is able to raise questions about privilege, the
                    uses of violence, and the futility of war."
                </p>
                <p>--People</p>
                <p>"It is a steep challenge to write a book whose hero is, everyone knows, destined to become deeply
                    evil. Do we want to hear — now, after we know the endgame — that the young Voldemort was unfairly
                    saddled with a demerit in class or that the adolescent Sauron fretted because he had to wear
                    hand-me-down clothes? Yes, please."
                </p>
                <p>--The New York Times, Sarah Lyall</p>
                <p>"..."The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes'" clever exploration of the world and how its perverse forms
                    of entertainment and control came to be are bound to satisfy fans. It may not be a particularly
                    comforting form of escapism, but Collins' uneasy, thought-provoking prequel is absorbing all the
                    same."
                </p>
                <p>--Insider</p>
                <p>"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes describes how most lives are actually lived, the consequences of
                    countless small choices that ultimately amount to a big one: not just how to feel but who to be."
                </p>
                <p>--Slate Magazin </p>
                <p>"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a darkly satisfying origin story...It's a reminder of the
                    power of propaganda — how putting the veneer of a good narrative atop any awful thing can get people
                    to believe the message."
                </p>
                <p>--Polygon</p>
                <p>"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes...confirms Collins as a master of dystopian YA, able to spin
                    engaging tales around deeply flawed characters and societies."
                </p>
                <p>--New York Journal of Books</p>
                <p>
                    "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes builds on the original series' overt critique of violence and
                    those who perpetuate it, again in terms that speak to a more mature audience than their young-adult
                    marketing might suggest. For true fans of The Hunger Games, Collins shines most as she weaves in
                    tantalizing details that lend depth to the gruesome world she created in the original series and
                    Coriolanus's place in its history."
